    message: Restful webservice endpoint security should be analysed.
      Authentication, if enforced, should be tested. Access control, if
      enforced, should be tested. The inputs should be tracked for potential
      vulnerabilities. The communication should ideally be over SSL. If
      the  service supports writes (e.g., via POST), its vulnerability to CSRF
      should be investigated.
